            Hello World! I'm Joy. I am a detail-oriented full stack developer
            with an eye for design. I am a mother, a wife, and a hard-working
            professional who loves to learn and loves to code! What fascinates
            me the most about coding is the unlimited potential of what you can
            create with code. The world of coding is dynamically evolving and I
            love that there is always something new to learn.
