# My Portfolio - with React

## About
The goal of this assignment was to take my current portfolio [jxleilani.github.io](https://jxleilani.github.io) and turn it into a [React Application](https://jxleilani.github.io/react-portfolio) using components and state.

## Info
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
